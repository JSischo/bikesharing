## Overview of the Analysis
>The purpose of this analysis was to analyze New York City bike sharing data and present a summary using Tableau to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

>For this analysis I created a set of visualizations to:

>-Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
>-Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
>-Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
>Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
