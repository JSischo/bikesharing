# bikesharing

## Overview of the Analysis
>The purpose of this analysis was to pull data from a New York City bike sharing company and present a summary using Tableau to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

>For this analysis I created a set of visualizations to:
>1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
>2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
>3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
>4. Show the number of rides per user type.
>5. Show the peak times of the day for bike usage.
